# Cloud Computing

## What is a Server Composed of?

- **Compute:** CPU
- **Memory:** RAM
- **Storage:** Data
- **Database:** Store data in a structured way
- **Network:** Routers, switch, DNS server

## IT Terminology

- **Network:** Cables, routers, and servers connected with each other.
- **Router:** A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet.
- **Switch:** Takes a packet and sends it to the correct server/client on your network.

## Problems with Traditional IT Approach

- Pay for the rent for the data center.
- Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance.
- Adding and replacing hardware takes time.
- Scaling is limited.
- Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure.
- How to deal with disasters?

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computer power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing. You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need. You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly. It's a simple way to access servers, storage, databases, and a set of application services. Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

## Deployment Models of the Cloud

### Private Cloud

- Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
- Complete Control.
- Security for sensitive applications.
- Meet specific business needs.

### Public Cloud

- Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the internet.

### Hybrid Cloud

- Keep some servers on-premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud.
- Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure.
- Flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud.

## Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- **On-demand self-service:** User can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider.
- **Broad network access:** Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms.
- **Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:** Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy. Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources.
- **Rapid elasticity and scalability:** Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose of resources when needed. Quickly and easily scale based on demand.
- **Measured service:** Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they used.

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

- Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX).
- Pay On-Demand: donâ€™t own hardware.
- Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX).
- Benefit from massive economies of scale: Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale.
- Stop guessing capacity: Scale based on actual measured usage.
- Increase speed and agility.
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers.
- Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure.

## Problems Solved by the Cloud

- Flexibility: change resource types when needed.
- Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use.
- Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes.
- Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed.
- High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers.
- Agility: rapidly develop, test, and launch software applications.

## Types of Cloud Computing

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- Provide building blocks for cloud IT.
- Provides networking, computers, data storage space.
- Highest level of flexibility.
- Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure.
- Focus on the deployment and management of your applications.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

- Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider.

### Example of Cloud Computing Types

- **IaaS:** Amazon EC2, GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode.
- **PaaS:** Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Google App Engine, Windows Azure.
- **SaaS:** Many AWS services, Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom.

## Pricing of the Cloud

AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go pricing model:
- **Compute:** Pay for compute time.
- **Storage:** Pay for data stored in the cloud.
- **Data transfer OUT of the cloud:** Data transfer IN is free.

## AWS Cloud Number Facts

- In 2019, AWS had $35.02 billion in annual revenue.
- AWS accounts for 47% of the market in 2019 (Microsoft is 2nd with 22%).
- Pioneer and leader of the AWS
